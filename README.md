# 🚀 C++ Coding Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to coding exercises from **OBI (Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics), Neps Academy and Leetcode**, completed during my **Algorithms in C++ learning journey**. Each solution reflects my progress in understanding algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. 💡

Ps.: I'm still collecting some other execises from those platforms that I've done through the years
